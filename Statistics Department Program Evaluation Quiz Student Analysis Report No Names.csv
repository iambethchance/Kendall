"3799123: Problem 2: A home loan officer at a local bank has two different people to call on for home appraisals. (The job of the home appraiser is to inspect the house and decide how much money the house is worth.) The loan officer wants to collect data to compare the two appraisers so that she can tell whether they tend to give different appraisals. Currently she has access to about 20 homes in SLO County on which she can collect data, but each appraiser only has time to visit about 10 homes in one day.
Below are two possible study designs:

Design 1: Randomly assign 10 of the 20 homes to appraiser 1 and the other 10 homes to appraiser 2
Design 2: Randomly select 10 of the homes and have both appraisers visit these 10 homes.

Additionally, it allows for direct comparisons between the two appraisers, ensuring that any consistent discrepancies in valuation are clear.

By randomly assigning the 20 homes between the two appraisers, the study reduces selection bias and balances out potential confounding factors, such as home size, location, and condition, across both groups.

A p-value of 0.22 indicates that the observed data is not strongly in favor of rejecting the null hypothesis, but it does not provide definitive evidence of no difference. The key point is that a p-value of 0.22 is above the common significance level (α = 0.05), which means we fail to reject the null hypothesis, but this doesn't prove the null hypothesis is true.

Instead, the p-value indicates that the data does not provide strong enough evidence to conclude there is a statistically significant difference in the appraisals between the two appraisers. This means that any observed differences could easily be due to chance, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of a small or subtle difference.

A better way to phrase the statement: 

""Based on the analysis, we don't have enough evidence to say that there is a significant difference in the appraisal prices given by the two appraisers. The difference we observed could be due to random chance.""

This phrasing is more accurate because it reflects that the lack of significant evidence does not prove the two appraisers' appraisals are identical, only that we cannot confidently say they are different based on this data.",0,"I don't agree with that interpretation.

A p-value of 0.22 means that if there really is no difference between the appraisers, there's a 22% chance of getting the results we did (or something more extreme) just by random chance.

A better way to say this might be: 

""A p-value of 0.22 means that, assuming there’s no real difference between the appraisers, we’d expect to see results like this about 22% of the time.""

This way, it focuses on the likelihood of the results occurring if there’s no real difference between the appraisers.",0,"""I understand your concern about the distribution of appraisal values. While it’s true that having more homes can help make the distribution closer to normal, we don’t necessarily need perfect normality for the analysis, especially with 20 homes. According to the Central Limit Theorem, even if the data isn’t perfectly normal, the sampling distribution of the mean will still be approximately normal as the sample size gets bigger. So, for comparing the appraisers’ means, the t-test will usually still work well. But if you’re still concerned, we can check the data for normality using things like histograms or tests, and if needed, we can consider alternative methods.""",0,,0,"""I understand your concern. The negative coefficient on the number of bedrooms doesn’t mean that more bedrooms make a house cheaper. In this model, we’re also considering other factors like the home’s age and size.
