We are aiming for roughly 40 hours work on CourseKata related research unless we can find more money.  You are going to look into the LSAMP program (https://lsamp.calpoly.edu/apply-lsamp) but that would be for fall.  I wrote a plea to Jane but doubt there is much she can do. (Her reply was just a repeat)

CourseKata tasks
-	Reminder: ISI refers to the text we use in Stat 217/218 and ISCAM refers to the text we use in Stat 301. We have complete control over ISCAM but are also exploring different approaches for online materials in ISI.  Also: Sinem is teaching both Stat 217 and 218 this summer, mostly with ISI, and might be willing to participate in any mini-experiments and/or we could try for focus groups.
-	Report/recommendations from the focus group
-	Report/recommendations from the end of course survey
-	Review of Desmos/online labs/zyBooks: what are the essential features?

  --	Example Desmos activities for ISI https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/652078a1cd5bd54530b84368

  --	Example lab activities for ISCAM https://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/labs.html
      -- Update: Jotform version  https://www.jotform.com/202386005521142

  --	zyBooks

- Watch recording of Robin Lock’s talk for the portion on ebooks (e.g., need to be searchable, need to be able to take notes, provide instant feedback) – I have a note that that discussion was about 1:05 but I think that was raw time, not time into the presentation, maybe about 2/3 of the way?  6/23: His slides are now posted and the list on the slides is: table of contents, search, take notes, make flashcards, hyperlinks, real page numbers, links to video solutions, highligher, read aloud. For e-homework, the built in tolerances, algorithmic generating questions, links for assistance (hints, solution) and submit answer/immediate feedback.

o	Worth digging up my old online course? I could send you the senior project report on setting it up?

- Watch this video www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/videos/example1.1.mp4 and see whether you think something like this would be helpful and what are the minimum "frills" that would need to be added...

  Some students reflecting on their experiences in a similar course/best instructional practices.  Summarize?

  I used to have a "[do it yourself glossary]([url](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/workshop-statistics-discovery/9780470542040/48-appendix-a.html))". Could we "modernize" that and would it be more helpful than our online glossary?
Masters tasks for now
-	Read the attitudes articles?
-	Read the TAS article on statistical thinking?
-	There was a webinar yesterday  that I missed and may not be recorded, but here is the blurb.
o	The Teaching of Introductory Statistics: Results of a National Survey
o	Tuesday, June 18, 2024 | 4:00 - 4:30 pm ET
o	Presented by: Chelsey Legacy (University of Minnesota) and Pablo Vivas Corrales (University of Minnesota)
o	 Abstract: In this June edition of the JSDSE/CAUSE webinar series, we highlight the 2024 article The Teaching of Introductory Statistics: Results of a National Survey. The authors describe their use of the updated Statistics Teaching Inventory (STI) to examine the current state of the curricular and instructional practices being used by U.S.-based, college-level introductory statistics instructors. They explore the extent to which instructors report that their introductory statistics courses are aligned with recommended practices as outlined by the 2016 GAISE College Report. Data were collected from a sample of college-level U.S.-based, college-level introductory statistics instructors. Results based on 228 usable responses indicated that instructors, by-and-large, tended to be following the GAISE recommendations, especially related to content. However, courses may not yet be aligned with newer content recommendations (e.g., provide students opportunities to work with multivariate data), and there is still a large percentage of instructors that are not embracing student-oriented pedagogies and assessment methods.
